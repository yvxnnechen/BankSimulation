# BankSimulation
----------------------------------------------------------------
This application simulates a Bank where transactions of accounts are allowed. The output file contains all the transactions made, even if the transaction failed. It also includes the initial and final data bases of accounts sorted and unsorted. The totals of every account type and every account are calculated after the unsorted database is printed.
----------------------------------------------------------------
To run the program, use the initialAccounts.txt file for the initial accounts in the Bank and the myTestCases.txt file which contains a char and attributes for requesting transactions. Output is printed to the myOutput.txt file.
